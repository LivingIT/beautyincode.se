      When Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize for developing a new model of how the brain works, it changed how we think about thinking. 
      If you haven't had time to read Kahneman's book "Thinking Fast and Slow," or even if you have, Linda will "translate" the model and what it means for us in working better. 
      We know that our jobs involve thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. We all want to do a better job of thinking fast and slow. Linda will help you get started with that.

      This is NOT a talk about Scrum or Kanban. The Agile Manifesto is all about communication, interaction, collaboration and building trust. 
      Yet when most companies decide to go agile, they focus on implementing some rigid process that they don't yet fully understand, and they have a hard time getting it to work. We go back to the core of the Agile ideology. 
      We will talk about how you can use relational skills to improve communication, get team members engaged and build trust. Agile initiatives tend to become a matter limited to the developers, and it is often hard to engage other parts of the organisation. 
      In this workshop you will learn what make teams work efficiently and the basics of how you can get the whole organisation to cooperate better. 
      By building relations and trust between people, working on how they communicate and how they interact with each other, you will build the foundation of a truly agile organisation.
