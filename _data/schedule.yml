    offensive part of cyber security. He has more than 20 years of experience working

    In 2021, Swedish national television (SVT) aired a six-part TV series called “Hacked”
    where four professional hackers set out to hack into the private assets of normal people,
    celebrities, and companies. They had all agreed to participate in a cyber security
    experiment but were unaware of what exactly was going to happen. Linus was one of
    the four hackers in the TV series and in this talk, he is going to talk about some of
    the highlights that were seen on-screen as well as behind the scenes. This talk will
    hopefully be both entertaining and eye-opening.
