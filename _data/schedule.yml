    Linus is an independent security consultant and ethical hacker who focuses on the
    offensive part of cyber security. He has more than 20 years of experience working
    in the IT industry where the last 10 years have been spent exclusively doing
    penetration tests of applications and networks with a few social engineering
    assignments every now and then.

    In 2021, Swedish national television (SVT) aired a six-part TV series called “Hacked”
    where four professional hackers set out to hack into the private assets of normal people,
    celebrities, and companies. They had all agreed to participate in a cyber security
    experiment but were unaware of what exactly was going to happen. Linus was one of
    the four hackers in the TV series and in this talk, he is going to talk about some of
    the highlights that were seen on-screen as well as behind the scenes. This talk will
    hopefully be both entertaining and eye-opening.

    The possibilities of machine learning are ever expanding and therein lies prospects
    for a utopian AI-Human hybrid future. With increased opportunities to do good however
    there are just as many opportunities to do harm and even in the case that good intentions
    are at the helm, evidence suggests that opportunities for good may eventually prove
    to be the opposite. The greatest threat to what machine learning is able to achieve
    and to us as humans is twofold: Machine learning created with harmful biases built
    into its core with intent, and machine learning that does not reflect the diversity
    of the users it is meant to serve. The human experience is fundamentally flawed but
    how do we keep the worst parts of ourselves from manifesting in the machines we create?
