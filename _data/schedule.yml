    Lambdas. All the cool kid languages have them. But does 'lambda' mean what
    C#, Java, Python, C++, etc. mean by 'lambda'? Where did lambdas come from?
    What were they originally for? What is their relationship to data
    abstraction?

    In this session we will look into the history, the syntax and the uses of
    lambdas and the way in which lambda constructs in various languages do (or
    do not) match the original construct introduced in lambda calculus.

    One fine day, a developer was deep in the flow of coding; and beauty was
    pouring out of that keyboard.
    In a split second, the developer stopped.
    A tiny thought emerged.
    It scared the developer.
    It was too risky to attempt.
    It would tarnish the beauty that was created.
    The thought evaporated.
    The developer continued, ignoring the signs.
    Over time, it became harder and harder still to keep it beautiful.
    Eventually, the software was no more; and talk of it's beauty died with it.
    The developer pondered and went back in time to those moments of fear and
    wondered what would have happened if the risky option was attempted.
    That very thought scared the developer; and what came of this developer of
    beauty, we don't know.
    
    This talk is about taking risks; the beast that co-exists with beauty.
    I'll share some risks I've taken and what has helped me along the way;
    and why I embrace the beast that is risk.
