    Agile has become overly decorated, with vocabulary and rules to make your
    head spin. It wasn't intended that way. In this talk, Dr. Alistair Cockburn,
    one of the authors of the agile manifesto, shows how to abbreviate it all to
    just four words: Collaborate, Deliver, Reflect, Improve. Oddly, shortening it
    to those four words makes it easier to learn and more broadly applicable. Not
    only that, it helps us find new, relevant topics, such as guest leadership
    and solutions focus. What's best, these four words apply to all initiatives,
    not just software or product development.

    We all want to predictably deliver quality software solutions. Many
    technical and process methodologies have been created to make this
    possible. Yet time and again we repeat the age old patterns of late
    delivery and poor quality, ensuring we continue to face the backlash of
    unmet expectations. Could it be that while we profess to want to do better,
    our overt and hidden attachments to unproductive ways mean we self sabotage
    and follow patterns that ensure repeated failure? In this talk I'd like us
    to peel away the layers and take a close look at some of the ways that what
    we do ensures we do not get what we want. We have the tools to win we just
    need to choose to use them.

    Deep learning has revolutionized several application areas, especially within
    computer vision. However, developing systems that rely on machine learning (ML)
    introduces new challenges. As features are trained rather than coded, the beauty
    concept must expand to cover also data. But even with beauty in the training data,
    how could we possibly trust AI in critical applications such as self-driving cars?

    In this talk, we will look at testing of a pedestrian detection system in
    state-of-the-art automotive simulators. We will discuss how the concept of
    safety fundamentally changes with ML and present a promising approach to testing.
    By embracing beauty in test code, we will demonstrate evolutionary test case
    generation for testing of trained systems – using AI to test AI.

    Lambdas. All the cool kid languages have them. But does 'lambda' mean what
    C#, Java, Python, C++, etc. mean by 'lambda'? Where did lambdas come from?
    What were they originally for? What is their relationship to data
    abstraction?

    In this session we will look into the history, the syntax and the uses of
    lambdas and the way in which lambda constructs in various languages do (or
    do not) match the original construct introduced in lambda calculus.

    Many teams have a scaling problem that is relative to their business or
    industry, which is a long way off from the massively scaled companies such
    as Facebook and co. Many of these teams are inadvertently over-engineering
    for their needs. We need to learn to scale down right, simple as possible.
