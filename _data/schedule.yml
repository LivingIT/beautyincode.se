    Roy walks through the basics of what solidity smart contracts look like and what type of patterns are enabled through them. 
    We also discuss what practices become extra important(hint: testing, auditing), what practices become problematic (hint: continuous delivery), and what design patterns become problematic (hint: CRUD).

  bio: |
    Linus is an independent security consultant and ethical hacker who focuses on the
    offensive part of cyber security. He has more than 20 years of experience working
    in the IT industry where the last 10 years have been spent exclusively doing
    penetration tests of applications and networks with a few social engineering
    assignments every now and then.
  description: |
    In 2021, Swedish national television (SVT) aired a six-part TV series called “Hacked”
    where four professional hackers set out to hack into the private assets of normal people,
    celebrities, and companies. They had all agreed to participate in a cyber security
    experiment but were unaware of what exactly was going to happen. Linus was one of
    the four hackers in the TV series and in this talk, he is going to talk about some of
    the highlights that were seen on-screen as well as behind the scenes. This talk will
    hopefully be both entertaining and eye-opening.

    Arial, Times New Roman, Consolas, Comic Sans… digital typography has turned us all into typesetters. 
    The tools we use, the apps we build, the emails we send: with so much of our lives mediated by technology, something as seemingly innocuous as picking a typeface can end up defining our relationship with the systems we use, and become part of the identity that we project into the world. 
    Typography is a fundamental part of modern information design, with implications for user experience, accessibility, even performance - and when it goes wrong, it can produce some of the most baffling bugs you’ve ever seen.
    
    Join Dylan Beattie for a journey into the weird and wonderful history of digital typography, from the origins of movable type in 8th century Asia, to the world of e-ink displays and web typography. 
    We’ll look at the relationship between technology and typography over the centuries: the Gutenberg Press, Linotype machines, WYSIWYG and the desktop publishing revolution. 
    What was so special about the Apple II? 
    How do you design a pixel font? We’ll learn why they’re called upper and lower case, we’ll talk about why so many developers find CSS counter-intuitive - and we’ll find out why so many emails used to end with the letter J.

    The possibilities of machine learning are ever expanding and therein lies prospects
    for a utopian AI-Human hybrid future. With increased opportunities to do good however
    there are just as many opportunities to do harm and even in the case that good intentions
    are at the helm, evidence suggests that opportunities for good may eventually prove
    to be the opposite. The greatest threat to what machine learning is able to achieve
    and to us as humans is twofold: Machine learning created with harmful biases built
    into its core with intent, and machine learning that does not reflect the diversity
    of the users it is meant to serve. The human experience is fundamentally flawed but
    how do we keep the worst parts of ourselves from manifesting in the machines we create?

    Join Scott Hanselman for an upbeat discussion about what's beyond mentorship. 
    What's the difference between mentorship and sponsorship and how does that build successful teams? What's the role of the senior engineer as a colleague to an early-in-career engineer? 
    What's the difference between learning how to code and learning how to think about systems? What must we do to welcome the next generation of creators, and what are your responsibilities? 
    Let's facilitate a welcoming culture of learning and exploration and normalize not knowing the answer!
