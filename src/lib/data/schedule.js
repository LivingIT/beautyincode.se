    description: `Roy walks through the basics of what solidity smart contracts look like and
                  what type of patterns are enabled through them.
                  
                  We also discuss what practices become extra important(hint: testing,
                  auditing), what practices become problematic (hint: continuous delivery),
                  and what design patterns become problematic (hint: CRUD).
