  <h2>About the conference</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Beauty in Code</strong> is a single-track IT conference at Malmö Live, Sweden, brought
    to you by <a href="https://livingit.se">Living IT</a>. Every year in March we gather amazing
    speakers that are bringing new exciting material for a full day of learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our idea is to create a conference for everyone involved in the software industry. We put it on
    a Saturday so no-one gets denied due to work. We keep the fee very low so everyone can afford to
    attend. In fact, you only pay for the lunch and fika; the actual conference is on us, because we
    love to share knowledge and this is our way of giving back to the community.
  </p>

  <p>We wish <em>you</em> welcome to an inspiring day at Malmö Live!</p>
