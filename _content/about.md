## About the conference

**Beauty in Code** is a single-track IT conference at Malmö Live, Sweden, brought to you by [Living IT](https://livingit.se). Every year in March we gather six amazing speakers that are bringing new exciting material for a full day of learning.

Our idea is to create a conference for everyone involved in the software industry. We put it on a Saturday so no-one gets denied due to work. We keep the fee very low so everyone can afford to attend. In fact, you only pay for the lunch and fika; the actual conference is on us, because we love to share knowledge and this is our way of giving back to the community.

We wish *you* welcome to an **inspiring** day at Malmö Live!
