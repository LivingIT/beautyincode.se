# Beauty in Code

The Jekyll/Github Pages files for the future beautyincode.se

## Get up and running

The easiest way is to use Docker, then you only need to run

~~~bash
$ docker-compose up
~~~

…and you’re good to go!

## ⚠️  Be warned

This is super duper early alpha. Everything is ugly and broken and will be changed several times over without prior notice. You have been warned!
