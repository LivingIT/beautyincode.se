## 🐳 Get up and running

The easiest way is to use Docker, then you only need to run

~~~bash
$ docker compose up
~~~

…and you’re good to go!

## 🛠 Workflow

Deploy to production occur when a release is created on Github. A Github Actions automatically creates the next version to be relased and adds any pull requests merged to the `master` branch since the last release to the release notes.

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/LivingIT/beautyincode.se/releases)
2. Edit the draft release (make sure that it's up to date, i.e. let the automated workflow finish first if you’ve recently merged a PR. If there’s no draft, it likely means that no PRs or commits have been made or that the workflow isn’t finished yet)
3. Make sure that the title field matches the tag field (if the next version is for example `1.6.0` make sure both fields says `v1.6.0`)
4. Check that the release notes contain all relevant info (only merged PRs are automatically added to the notes, if you made commits directly to `master` you need to add those by hand)
5. Publish release

### Development environment

Commits to `master` are automatically deployed to [https://dev.beautyincode.se](https://dev.beautyincode.se).
