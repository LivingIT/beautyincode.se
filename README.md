## üõ† Workflow

_This repo is automatically deployed from the `master` branch. **Do not commit directly to `master` unless you know what you are doing!**_

Since Github auto-deploys from `master`, we're employing a simplified version version of Git Flow, where development is henceforth being done only on `develop`. When any feature is ready for deployment, make a pull request, make sure any tests pass (WIP) and merge.
